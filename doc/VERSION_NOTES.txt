0.2.3

edited praatSound.py normalize() function so that it wouldn't just normalize phonemes in the vowel list, but would normalize every interval passed to it

edited Project.py addToWeka() function to make it add all intervals to data, not just vowels

edited Project.py addToWeka() function to make it only print out the first 5 digits after the decimal point

edited Project.py convertTextgrid() so that it would split apart txtgrid files with any number of tiers

edited Project.py createWEKAFile() function so that the "phoneme_type" attribute doesn't use a ready-set list of phonemes, but rather gets the list from the db file itself

added support for flags:
    --tag = user specified tag to look for (not just FILLEDPAUSE)
    --tagtier = user specified tier which contains the tag (default=word)
    --prosodytier = user specified tier over which to do prosodic information extraction




0.2.2

_  not completed
* completed

Goals:

 * make labeling reversed, i.e. make the phoneme with the middle of the filled pause 
 * for sphinx, change filled pauses to "ah" and "um"
 * change surrounding silence measurements to fix them -output ratio of silence vs. voiced for surrounding.  
 	xxx occasionally gives a too large value. don't kno why.

 _ make db input/output faster
	for output, read one and sort through rather than queueing all the time
	for input, do the begin/process/commit thing
		xxx doesn't speed it up, though it does seem to work. figure out where the time is being spent.  
		xxx there's still a lot of writing to disk when there shouldn't be. figure out why.

 *implement plotting

 * fix the problem that comes up with the last 2 files and adding int and NoneType
     ++this only happens when doing the arff business, b/c the db files have no entries in them
     WHY DO THEY HAVE NO ENTRIES??!?!???!??!?  
     arff was being created before all files were done processing - need to do:
         #makes sure everything closes correctly
    pool.close()
    pool.join()
    in Project file
  
 *put helper files in temp folders so they don't clutter up the main folder
